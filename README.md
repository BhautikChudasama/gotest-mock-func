### Golang Mocking

I want to understand mocking, and stubing in golang, So this repo I have created simple sms sending functionality.

In the `app.go`, We are using `smsbroker` package and send sms. I had implemented basic mocking testing but this didn't feel confident.

If you think you can improve testing feel free to PR.
